── UNRECOGNIZED PACKAGE in tests/test-projects/module_imports_pkg/Module.roc ───

This module is trying to import from `pkg`:

3│  import pkg.Foo
           ^^^^^^^

A lowercase name indicates a package shorthand, but I don't recognize
this one. Did you mean one of these?

    pf

Note: I'm using the following module to resolve package shorthands:

    /home/luigi/rocfork/roc/main.roc

You can specify a different one with the --main flag.
